# paintstorm-redesign
Redesign of Paintstorm Studio website. No affiliation.
Mostly did it for fun after I saw how bad their website is (was).
Its not perfect and I would change a lot if it would be a real commercial project but it was meant to be a prototype and project for fun.
The descriptions are mostly copy pasted from the original website and used as a placeholder. The animated previews were made by me

Prototype preview: https://artbarte.github.io/Paintstorm-website-rework/

To design the website used Figma. Prototype was made with tailwindcss and glider.js for img carousel.
Normally I would use webpack and more organized workflow but for the size of this project I only used cli and simple html.

Note about Tailwind: I used tailwindcss as a experiment to try it out. At first it was a little weird workflow for me - but after getting used to it, I felt VERY productive. The time I spent making a prototype website was very small compared to normal workflow I would choose.
